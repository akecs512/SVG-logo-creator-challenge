# SVG-logo-creator-challenge

## Description

Generates simple SVG logo.


##Usage

In a command-line application that accepts user input the user is prompted for text up to three characters, the text color, a choice of shape from a list, and a shape color.
After the user enters input for all the prompts, an SVG file is created named `logo.svg` and "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line.
Whe the `logo.svg` file is opened in a browser a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria is shown.
